    <h1>JS-Interview Preparation DAY4</h1>

    <h4>1.What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h4>
    <p>Temporal means something temporary, not permanent, and Dead means something which has no life,Zone related to area has no life where the code is inaccessible</p>
    <p>It is a period of time during which let and const variables will not be accessed</p>
    <p>If you want to access those values move the variable to the top of the scope</p>
    <p>While inside the TDZ, the variable has not been initialized with a value, and any attempt to access it will result in a ReferenceError. </p>

    <h4>2.What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h4>
    <p>loops through the properties of an object.</p>
    <p>The for-in loop is a special type of a loop that iterates over the properties of an object, arrays and strings</p>
    <p> The generic syntax of the for-in loop is:</p>
    <pre>
        
        for(variable in object) {
            // Code to be executed
        }
    </pre>

    <h4>3.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h4>
    <p>Local scope:Local Scope occurs when you create a variable inside a function. By doing that, the visibility and accessibility of the variable is only allowed within that function.</p>
    <p>Local scope: Scope inside which we define variables as well as functions and restirct the all the types of variables methods to that scope only</p>
    <p>Block scope: A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside the block even if the block is inside a function</p>
    <p>This will restrict the let and const variables to the block only</p>
    <p>Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function</p>
    <p>Scope Chain: means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used by another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope)</p>
    
    <h4>4.What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h4>
    <p>Undefined:Try to access the variable before declaration and A variable that has not been assigned a value</p>
    <p>null:null that represents intentionally putting null as a value</p>
    <p>Both the things are not used.null we can assign as a value to a variable if don't have value to give</p>

    <h4>5.what is Symbol?</h4>
    <p>New primitive data type which is introduced in ES6 version . symbols that are immutable and symbols that are can not be changed , Every symbol is unique and it is returning boolean value</p>

    <h4>6.Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h4>
    <p>Both are array method that are used in arrays</p>
    <p>The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one,it will iterate over a perticular array </p>
    <p>filter():filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong</p>

    <h4>7.Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h4>
    <p>pass by value works with primitive data type ,Every time we assign a value to a variable a copy of that value will be created Every single time</p>
    <p>Pass by reference works with non primitive data type</p>

    <h4>8.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h4>
    <p>self Invoking function is IIFE(Immediately Invoke function).Just after its declaration it needs to be called.
    </p>
    <pre>
        (function() {
            // body of the function
            })();
    </pre>
    <h4>9.What is an event loop and call stack</h4>
    <p>Main work of event loop is to check the call stack if it is empty or not.call stack works in First In Last Out.Call stack consist of that are not having waiting period</p>
    <p>waiting period in the place called call stack completely empty, event loop comes into action and check the waiting queue anything to execute.call stack where we are setting time and waiting queue(FIFO).It will bring out from the queue,bring inside call stack and starts executing.</p>
